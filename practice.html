    A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show signoficant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill,typically rising at least 300 metres (1,000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountains ranges.
