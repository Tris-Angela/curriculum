    A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show signoficant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a pmited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill,typically rising at least 300 metres (1,000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountains ranges.</div>

    <h2>CSS3 Introduced Media Queries</h2>
    <p>Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.</p>
    <p>Media queriescan be used to check many things, <br>such as;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>width and height of the viewport</li>
        <li>width & height of the device</li>
        <li>orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)</li>
        <li>resolution</li>
    </ul>
